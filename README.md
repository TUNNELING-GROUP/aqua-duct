OVERVIEW

    This package comprises of two elements:
    1) aquaduct,
    2) valve.
    Aqua-Duct is a Python module. It is a collection of tools to trace
    residues in MD simulation.
    Valve is a driver Python script. It uses aquaduct to perform such
    a tracing.

INSTALL

    AQUA-DUCT

        Installation was tested on limited number of POSIX-like systems.
        In some specific cases installation is very simple:
        1) Unpack aquaduct bundle file.
        2) Go to src directory.
        3) Type:
            python setup.py install

        Aquaduct requires several Python modules to work and in
        particular it requires MDAnalysis with AMBER support. This, on
        the other hand, requires netCDF4.
        Installation of this combination is sometimes cumbersome.
        General procedure is following:
        1) Install libnetcdf4 and libhdf5 development libraries.
        2) Install netCDF4:
            pip install netCDF4
        3) Try to install aquaduct.
        If, by chance, you are on Ubuntu 14.04 you can try helper script
        ubuntu_mdanalysis_install_helper.sh.

    VALVE

        Valve does not need installation per se. Once aquaduct is
        installed, valve can be run by a following command:
            valve.py --help
        Valve script, ie valve.py, is located in apps directory.

    EXTRAS

        Access to some visualisation capabilities of Aquaduct requires
        additional Python modules:
        1) matplotlib,
        2) pymol.
        These are usually easy to install.
